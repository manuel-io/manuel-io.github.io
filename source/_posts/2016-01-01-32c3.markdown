Diese Stunden geht der [32C3-Kongress][32c3] in Hamburg zu Ende und ich
habe mir via Video-Stream einige Vorträge angesehen. Also wie üblich
hier eine kurze Zusammenfassung:

* [The exhaust emissions scandal][dieselgate]:
  {% quotation %}
  Analysis of the emission scandal shaking the German automotive
  industry from a procedural, organizational and technical level.
  Includes insight into cheating for advanced managers and code
  extraction from ECUs from Ebay. And from Volkswagen. Initially.

  LWN: [Inside the Volkswagen emissions cheating][lwn].

  {% endquotation %}

* [The Perl Jam 2][perl2]:
  Last year there was a talk called [The Perl Jam: Exploiting a 20

  Website. It's free. Free as in free beer. Here you can find an
  example for the [Let's Encrypt][myacme] workflow.

* [Ten years after ‚We Lost The War‘][lostthewar2]:
  Ten years ago, Rob & Frank gave a [talk][wltw] _We lost the war_.
  That was 2005. Now, they give additional explanations and make some
  conclusions.
