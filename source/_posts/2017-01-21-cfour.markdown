{% img /data/images/cfour.jpg Playing Field %}

This is another LED-Matrix with some extra features. You see the
LCD-Display in the picture on top and a wireless touch controller on
the lower left side.

{% figure left /data/images/bi.png Dual-Color LED, 2 Pins %}

The main body is a matrix of 36 LEDs, however each single LED can
light up in red or green. Thus we have 72 lights in total. There're
12 cathodes and 12 anodes.

On the logical side we have 24 discrete tranistors, a 24 bit shift
unit and a ATmega8 micocontroller. There is absolutley no magick in
it.

Eveyhing is made for interaction and can be used as a playing field.
The default app is a Connect 4 Game, but even some another games (like
Snake etc.) could be possible.

More information is summarized on the related [GitHub][github] page.
