### Selfmade Modem 
{% img left /data/images/usb-lte-modem.jpg 300 DIY USB-LTE Modem %}

Due to the lack of internet and phone connectivity it is not easy to document
my work on this blog. The only mitigation is using a mobile connection. And no,
phone calls with the provider are not really helpful. Every conversation
begins with the same conclusion. The router does not synchronize. No progress
since 27 November.

To provide upstream connectivity to the local network I decided to connect a
usb-lte stick to an odroid device which in turn is connected to the upstream
socket of an old wifi router device.

This way each terminal device in the local net even if wired or wireless has
connection to the global net.

### Simulating Traffic
Another project is the simulation of street traffic on a canvas map. This
project has been in the queue for a long time. Because it is very time
consuming and needs some calculations I can hardly say when I can write more
about it. The good news is I had a little time to get back in here over the
holidays

Maybe I will publish some source code at some day, but it is still very
experimental.

### 36C3 - Resource Exhaustion
At the end of 2019 the 36C3 congress took place in East Germany and has many
good presentations [online on its website][36c3]. Even the performance on stage
has improved over the last years.

In Germany most popular are the talks [BahnMining - PÃ¼nktlichkeit ist eine
Zier][bahnmining] and [Hirne Hacken][hirnehacken]. Both deal with a
physiological influence of our society. Depending on the level of interest
there are a lot of other talks with more techniqual aspects.
