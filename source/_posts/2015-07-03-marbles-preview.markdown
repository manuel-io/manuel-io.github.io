One of my favorite games is Marbles. Basically it's a puzzle game. I
implemented my favorite level at first which is not for beginners, so
the learning curve is high. In the meantime you can try the [native
version][native].

<iframe
  style='width:100%;height:465px;'
  src='/data/marbles/index.html'
  frameborder='0'>
</iframe>

* Click on a marble to active it.
* Use the arrow keys to decide in which direction to move.
* Once in motion a marble will stop until it hits the wall or another
marble.
* Goal is to match the pattern which is given by the light marbles.

**Update:** I've created another [level][level] for beginners.
