After tumor extirpation they told me I need extra treatment, I need a chemo
therapy in addition to a radiation therapy. They implanted a
[Rickham-Reservoir][rickham] into my brain. They needed three
[surgical interventions][surgical]. Now I'm almost blind on my right eye
and they say it's not even worse then a pneumonia, but if you don't follow
our recommendations you will die anyway. You can't imagine how it feels.
