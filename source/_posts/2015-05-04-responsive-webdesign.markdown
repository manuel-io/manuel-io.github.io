Maybe you have noticed there are a few changes on this site. I'm
working on a minimalistic [octopress-theme][cats] which is basically a
[mock-up][theme]. Main goal is to design a responsive website which
works on both mobile and desktop devices. This also includes math
equations:

### Cauchy's integral theorem
{% equation %}
  f(\zeta) = \frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint_\gamma \frac{f(z)}{z-\zeta}\, dz
{% endequation %}

### Gauss equation
{% equation %}
  \int_\Omega\bigtriangledown f(x)\,dx = \int_{\partial\Omega} f(x)\cdot v(x)\,dS(x)
{% endequation %}

### Normal distribution
{% equation %}
  \Phi(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
{% endequation %}

###  Schr√∂dinger equation
{% equation %}
  i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(r, t) =
\left(\frac{-\hbar^2}{2m}\bigtriangledown^2 + V(r,t)\right)\Psi(r,t)
{% endequation %}

Please be patient if you don't like the new colors. Work is still in
progress.
