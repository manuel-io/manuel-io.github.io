<blockquote>
<p>It was always my hope, in writing novels and stories which asked the
question "What is reality?", to someday get an answer. This was the hope of
most of my readers, too. Years passed. I wrote over thirty novels and over a
hundred stories, and still I could not figure out what was real. One day a
girl college student in Canada asked me to define reality for her, for a paper
she was writing for her philosophy class. She wanted a one-sentence answer. I
thought about it and finally said, "Reality is that which, when you stop
believing in it, doesn't go away." That's all I could come up with. That was
back in 1972. Since then I haven't been able to define reality any more
lucidly.</p>
